# Web map using Twitter API

In this project were realized two tasks using Twitter API.

The first task, which was realized in module navigation_task2.py, allows user to eneter a Twitter nickname and navigate through inforamation about the entered user.
The second task allows user to eneter a Twitter username on a website and see a map with locations of entered user's friends.
