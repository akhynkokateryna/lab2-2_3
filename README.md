# Web map using Twitter API

In this project were realized two tasks using Twitter API.<br>
At first, in module twitter2.py was generated a dictionary from a JSON file received with the use of Twitter API.
The first task, which was realized in module navigation_task2.py, allows user to eneter a Twitter nickname and navigate through inforamation about the entered user.
The second task allows user to eneter a Twitter username on a website and see a map with locations of entered user's friends.<br>
To generate cordinates from users' locations was used library geopy, and to generate map was used library folium.
To ensure the interoperability of all files, was used framework Flask.

That is an example of a website:
